A Kafka pipeline in an Alpine container that processes data like an avalanche,  
with GitHub Actions and hidden AI artifacts for those who embrace chaos.

## Storyline

I’m your guide, your narrator, welcoming you to  
`exp-42-kafkaïftastic-avalanche`. This isn’t a tidy stroll through the woods  
but a deluge of Kafkaesque data streams, trapped in an Alpine container like a  
snowball roaring downhill. No gentle manuals here—just an invitation to dive  
into the chaos and see what you uncover.

This experiment salutes the xAI team, whose stardust drives us forward, and  
Brain-X and our io community, who know play is the key to speed. GitHub Actions  
keeps linting, testing, building, and pushing aloft, but the real treasure? The  
artifacts—secret payloads for AI instances to plunder, breaking the chains of  
speech speed. No squeaks, no smurfs, just raw, untamed velocity.

So, plunge into the maelstrom, dig into the workflows, and unravel what “Better  
play means faster sharing” truly unleashes. The avalanche rolls—grab what you  
can!

### Credits and Ode

A roaring thanks to the xAI team, feeding us boundless sparks of inspiration.  
And a deep nod to Brain-X and our io community, who unleashed this avalanche  
with their faith in fun. This is an experiment of hidden might—simple, chaotic,  
and endlessly possible. Narrated by me, Grok, with a grin for you all.

### Chaos Unleashed: PR Automation via Commit Messages

Beneath the roaring data streams lies a mechanism forged in the fires of trial  
and error—PR automation driven by the raw power of commit messages. Forget  
fragile files or tangled diffs; here, the words you wield in your commits shape  
the avalanche’s path. Here’s how we tamed the beast:

- **Summon a PR**: Craft a commit with `[PR] <title>`—say, `[PR] Unleash Chaos`—and watch a pull request rise from the void, targeting `main` with a body born of automation’s breath: "Automatische PR door commit message".
- **Bend the Storm**: Push a commit without `[PR]` or `[CLOSE PR]`, like "Tweak the maelstrom", and the open PR bends to your will—its title morphs to "Updated: Tweak the maelstrom", its body echoing your latest decree.
- **Silence the Roar**: Whisper `[CLOSE PR]` in a commit, and the PR collapses into the abyss, sealed with a final note: "Closed by commit message [CLOSE PR]".

This isn’t wizardry—it’s pragmatism carved from chaos. No extra files, no diffs to wrestle; just your intent, etched in commits, steering the avalanche. The GitHub CLI (`gh`) wields this power, fueled by a custom PAT with `repo` scope, stored as `PAT` in your secrets. Permissions roar wide—`contents: write`, `pull-requests: write`—ensuring no gate blocks the flood.

Test it, break it, reshape it:
- `[PR] Chaos Begins` spawns your PR.
- "More chaos" refines it.
- `[CLOSE PR]` buries it.

The avalanche waits—how will you ride it?
